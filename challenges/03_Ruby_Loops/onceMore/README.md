## One more Time

What are the main [ruby loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm)?

- the`for` loop
- the `while` loop

## Goal

Write a method in ruby that computes the sum of the integers between a min value and a max value (min and max
included). So for example, if you have a min of 1 and a max of 5 your values are: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. When you add
them up you get 15.

In the case the min value is greather than the max value, your method should return -1.

## Requirements

Implement both simple versions, using `for..end` and `while..end` loops.

## In addition:

Answer this basic question:

- What is the main difference between using a `while..end` and a `for..end` loop?
