## Ruby Loops

Ruby doesn't use loops as much as some other programming languages, but instead we use iteration.
Ruby [iterators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_iterators.htm) can often replace loops.

Whatsover, there are cases where we still do use [loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm) in Ruby.
Check out the tutorialspoint and try some simple looping.

The two looping methods in Ruby are:
- for loops
- while loops

### Iterations:

In addition to the loops we wrote here, let's try some basic Iterations.

Check out arrays.rb, and run it. What other cool things could we do with iterators? Try writing a method that finds if there is a certain string in an array.

Your result should look something like that:

```bash

ruby arrays.rb

What do you want to search for?
Something
sorry the array does not contain your search value.

```
