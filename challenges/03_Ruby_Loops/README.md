## Ruby Loops

Ruby doesn't use loops as much as some other programming languages, but instead we use iteration.
Ruby [iterators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_iterators.htm) can often replace loops.

Whatsover, there are cases where we still do use [loops](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_loops.htm) in Ruby.
Check out the tutorialspoint and try some simple looping.

The two looping methods in Ruby are:
- for loops
- while loops

Try to write two simple code examples, or if you can put both loops into one example. A good idea would be setting a range, counting
through it in a for loop and then asking the user if he wants to go again, which would require a while loop to repeat.
