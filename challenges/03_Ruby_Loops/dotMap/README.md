## Ruby .map method

Check out the ruby [.map](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Array.html#method-i-map) method.
This is a method that is used to create a new array from an existing array.
As this methods iterates over existing data, it at the same time writes data, which
can be helpful when trying to keep your code lean.

### Compare

In the map.rb file use both methods and compare the output to get a better undertanding for the
different methods.

### Operators

Read up on [Ruby logic operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_operators.htm).
The syntax is not important, but I encourage you to learn ||, &&, !, as these are pretty standard.
