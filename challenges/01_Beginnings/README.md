## Challenge
- Learn to use ruby [docs](http://ruby-doc.org/).
- Get familiar with IRB.
- Find out about string manipulation in Ruby.

IRB is a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop). Check it out by typing:

```bash
irb
```

### GOALs
Use the following methods in Ruby, by either typing them in RIB, or by writing a small script:
- .include?
- .strip
- .sort
- .reverse
- .size
- .sample
