## Challenge

- Learn about some more complex Ruby methods.
- Get familiar with basic math operators.

### GOALs

Use the Ruby methods [Date](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.2/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html) and [Time](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Time.html) to build a small script that tells you your age in days.
If that is not challenging enough include your age in hours/minutes and seconds, and see how much detail you can get from Ruby.
