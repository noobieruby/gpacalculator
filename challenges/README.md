## Instructions

In order to solve these challenges you should first pull the READMEs into your local repo:

```bash
git pull
```

You can also type:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

Make sure you are in your git folder.

When you are done make sure to push your solution in the correct folder and add a commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "A good description"
git push origin master
```

Keep in mind that when working on other repos, we never push to master, but only to specific branches.
